## Authentication

### [# rodauth](#rodauth)

  [https://rodauth.jeremyevans.net](https://rodauth.jeremyevans.net)

Rodauth is Ruby's most advanced authentication framework, designed
to work in all rack applications.  It's built using Roda and Sequel,
but it can be used as middleware in front of web applications that use
other web frameworks and database libraries.

Rodauth aims to provide strong security for password storage by
utilizing separate database accounts if possible on PostgreSQL,
MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.  Configuration is done via
a DSL that makes it easy to override any part of the authentication
process.

Rodauth supports typical authentication features: such as login and
logout, changing logins and passwords, and creating, verifying,
unlocking, and resetting passwords for accounts.  Rodauth also
supports many advanced authentication features:

* Secure password storage using security definer database functions
* Multiple primary multifactor authentication methods (WebAuthn and
  TOTP), as well as backup multifactor authentication methods (SMS
  and recovery codes).
* Passwordless authentication using email links and WebAuthn
  authenticators.
* Both standard HTML form and JSON API support for all features.

#### 游릭 Pros

  * One of the key benefits of using Rodauth is that it provides a consistent and secure implementation of these features, following best practices for security and user experience. This can save time and reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities, as developers do not have to reinvent the wheel and can instead rely on well-tested code.
  * Rodauth is highly customizable and extensible, allowing developers to easily modify or add new features as needed. This means that it can be adapted to meet the specific needs of different projects, while still providing a solid foundation for authentication and authorization.
  * Rodauth can be used with Rails or any other Rack application, making it a flexible and versatile solution for authentication and authorization.
  * To use Rodauth with Rails, you should use `rodauth-rails` [https://github.com/janko/rodauth-rails](https://github.com/janko/rodauth-rails) gem, which provides a simple and straightforward way to integrate Rodauth into a Rails application.
